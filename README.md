# BeerScraper
## Python code to scrape BeerAdvocate reviews

This currently fully working, however it is still a work in progress. Eventually this will be used to construct a huge dataset of beer word-frequency data, which will then be used to build a beer recommendation system. 

To-Do:
 - Consider removing words with very few mentions (likely to be typos or made-up words) [easy]
 - Add functionality to manually add new beers to dataset [easy]
